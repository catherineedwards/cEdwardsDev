# Portfolio website

Hi, I'm Cathy, looking to deepen and expand my web development skills.

You've stumbled across the source code for my website, which will be hosted on `cedwards.dev`

It was created with `create-react-app`, so to run locally:

`git clone git@github.com:catherineedwards/cEdwardsDev.git` or `https://github.com/catherineedwards/cEdwardsDev.git`
`cd my-app`
`yarn start`

## Goals

1. Basic site hosted on AWS EC2 instance
2. Fully-fledged React app with authentication, database, and web services for hosting a blog
3. Automating updates to app with a CI/CD pipeline
4. Learn, learn, and learn some more!
